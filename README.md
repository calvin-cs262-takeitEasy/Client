# Client

This is the client for our app, Commit. This code creates an app using React Native and Expo Go that interacts with our data service. Using alarms and timers, our app keeps you accountable by sending Comms to your friends on the app when you fail to complete your commitments. 

To test, press the word "Login" on the login page to access a dummy account.
